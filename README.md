# Welcome to Reactive Extensions for Python
Reactive Extensions for Python is a port from the original .NET library http://rx.codeplex.com.

> The Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and SQL-style query operators. Using Rx, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using SQL operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. Simply put, Rx = Observables + SQL + Schedulers.

{"name":"RxPython","tagline":"Reactive Extensions for Python ported from Rx.NET","body":"### Welcome to Reactive Extensions for Python\r\nReactive Extensions for Python is a port from the original .NET library http://rx.codeplex.com.\r\n\r\n> The Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and SQL-style query operators. Using Rx, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using SQL operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. Simply put, Rx = Observables + SQL + Schedulers.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nYou can find the documentation for RxPython [here](http://pythonhosted.org/RxPython/)\r\n\r\nAdditional documentation can be found on:\r\n\r\n* http://rxwiki.wikidot.com/101samples\r\n* http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/rx/threads\r\n* http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n* If you have pip installed:\r\n    pip install rxpython\r\n\r\n* Manual installation:\r\n1. Download eihter the [newest version](https://github.com/akuendig/RxPython/zipball/master) or on of the [tagged releases](https://github.com/akuendig/RxPython/tags) and extract them.\r\n2. Open your favourite command line and navigate to the extracted folder.\r\n3. Run `python setup.py install`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

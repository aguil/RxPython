{"name":"RxPython","tagline":"Reactive Extensions for Python ported from Rx.NET","body":"# Welcome to Reactive Extensions for Python\r\nReactive Extensions for Python is a port from the original .NET library http://rx.codeplex.com.\r\n\r\n> The Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and SQL-style query operators. Using Rx, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using SQL operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. Simply put, Rx = Observables + SQL + Schedulers.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nYou can find the documentation for RxPython [here](http://pythonhosted.org/RxPython/).\r\n\r\nAdditional documentation can be found on:\r\n\r\n* http://rxwiki.wikidot.com/101samples\r\n* http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/rx/threads\r\n* http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n* If you have pip installed:\r\n\r\n  `pip install rxpython`\r\n\r\n* Manual installation:\r\n  1. Download eihter the [newest version](https://github.com/akuendig/RxPython/zipball/master) or on of the [tagged releases](https://github.com/akuendig/RxPython/tags) and extract them.\r\n  2. Open your favourite command line and navigate to the extracted folder.\r\n  3. Run `python setup.py install`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issues tracker\r\nReport issues at https://github.com/akuendig/RxPython/issues\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis project is distributed under the MIT license:\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013, Adrian KÃ¼ndig All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\r\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to\r\ndeal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the\r\nrights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or\r\nsell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
